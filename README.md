# bitbar test project

# log
# 1. Let;s do it inside a VM, since I've got no linux at home!
# 2. ...or maybe not, if I want to run a VM inside another VM, I must use a 32=bit OS. Do they even do that?
# 3. OK, I think I might try to do it on my work computer, I will use debian/jessie64.
# 4. vboxmanage showvminfo spawns beautiful segfault, I've got rolling release (6.0.something), it must be to new to work. I think I will try libvirt provider tomorrow.S
